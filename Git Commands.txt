1. Create a GitHub Account through website and create a repository.
2. Create a folder in our local machine and open the vscode from that directory.
3. copy the link of our repository and clone it into our local repository
git clone <https://>
4. Update the README.md file by writing something and create a file in the same directory in local machine.
git status
git add .
git commit -m <"add some message here">
git push origin main (if you are doing this for the first time then you need to confirm)
5. Now refresh the GitHub account to see the changes.

Q. How to know the specific folder created in our local machine is a git repository?

git init

With the above command we can see the .git folder, which git understands it's a git repository

6. Create a repo in GitHub(remote) and push it to the local machine

git remote add origin <https://> (link of the created repo)

Q. How to check the remote operation has done successfully?

git remote -v

Q. How to change the branch name?

git branch -M <branch name>

Q. What is the command to enter when we are pushing the code on same project without entering "origin main"

git push -u origin main

# From next time just enter "git push"

Q. What is the command to create a new branch?

git checkout -b <branch name>

Q. How to change from one branch to another branch?

git checkout <branch name>

Q. What is the command to delete any specific branch?

git branch -d <branch name>

** We cannot delete the branch we are there/working/present, we should come to another branch/master branch then check which branch you want to delete

Q How to push the other branch code to main branch?

way 1
Q. What is the command to check the difference between two branches?

git diff <branch name>

git merge <branch name>

way 2
Create PR (Pull Request) from GitHub

click on "Compare & pull request" from GitHub

check if there are any conflicts

Q. How get the changes done in remote?

git pull origin main

Q. How to resolve the merge conflicts?

git merge <branch name> we should give other branch name

Then you will get a message that Git is unable to resolve difference in code between two commits. So, we should keep both the files and save
git add .
git commit -m <message>
git checkout main

Here you won't be able to see the changes, if you need other branch merge into main branch then use below command
Go to main branch and hit below command

git merge <branch name>

Q. How to undo changes
Method 1

git reset <filename> #for single file
git reset # for multiple file names

Q. How to undo changes for one commit back
Method 2

git reset HEAD~1

Q. How to undo changes for many commits (like first commit we did)
Method 3

git reset <commit hash/commit id>

Q. How to undo changes from local machine/GitHub

git reset --hard <commit hash/commit id>

With the above command, you go back to the first commit you have done.

Q. What is the command to check all the commits?

git log

Q. How to copy others code to our GitHub account?

We should use FORK option which is available in project (GitHub)

Q. What is the diff between centralized and distributed version control system?

Centralized
A single copy of the codebase is stored in a central location, and developers commit their changes to that copy.

Distributed
Each developer has a local copy of the codebase, including its full history, on their own computer.
